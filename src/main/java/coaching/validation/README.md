# MODULE 2 - Validation

## Exercise Format
Exercise is designed to follow Test-Driven Development principles, which means your implementation
must pass all unit tests as definition of done. We have defined set of classes and methods that
you need to implement.

## Required Knowledge
- Java Basic (conditional statement, loop, string manipulate...) 
- Java Reflection API
- Java Annotation

## Requirements
- Implement validation engine that utilizes field-level annotation to run rules against declared 
  fields. After validation, violation set is returned that contains which field violates which rules.
- The engine should be extensible which means that you could add your custom validation rule with
  very little effort. For this one, please propose your approach, implement it and then write unit
  tests to validate this aspect.
- Code documentation is required (apply to public method and class), it should clarify the
  purpose and usage.
- Implementation must align to coding conventions which is readable, maintainable, extensible.
- All unit tests must be passed, which determine your result.
